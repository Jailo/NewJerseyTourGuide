# New Jersey Tour Guide
---
This android app shows a list of some of the best places to visit in the garden state.
You'll find some of the most beautiful places to stay, the top malls & farmers market to shop in, 
as well as sightseeing/tours, & other fun things to do, indoors and out.



### Motivation - Why this project exists
---
I created this project as part of Udacity's Android Basics: Multiscreen Apps course. I was very excited to have the 
task of going off on my own & practice everything I'd learned throughout the course. 
So I decided to make it about my home state, & show some of the best places to visit, as well as a few 
of my personal favorites.
