### Motivation - Why this project exists
I created this project as part of Udacity's Android Basics: Multiscreen Apps course. I was very excited to have the 
task of going off on my own & practice everything I'd learned throughout the course. 
So I decided to make it about my home state, & show some of the best places to visit, as well as a few 
of my personal favorites.
